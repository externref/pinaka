<i><b>"Bhagavad Gita"</b></i> which translates to "the song of God" is a part of one of the
two well-known <i>itihasas <b>"Mahabharata"</b></i
>. Occupying chapters 23 to 40 of the sixth book of <i>Mahabharata</i>, it is composed in
the form of a dialogue between <i>Arjuna</i>, the prince who was preoccupied with morals
and emotional dilemma about the despair, violence, and the number of deaths this
<i>Dharma yudha</i> between the <i>Pandavas</i> and <i>Kauravas</i> is going to cost, and
<i>Shri Krishna</i>, the avatar ( incarnation ) of god <i>Vishnu</i> who counsels him to
fulfill his <i>Kshatriya Dharma</i> ( duty of a warrior ) to uphold <i>Dharma</i> through
<i>Karma</i>.
